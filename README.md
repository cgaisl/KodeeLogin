# KodeeLogin - Sharing UI Across Platforms With Compose Multiplatform

This project showcases Compose Multiplatforms' ability to share a Composable containing resources and complex animations across multiple platforms.

The showcase Composable is a Login UI component with an Animation of Kotlin's new mascot, Kodee, spying on your input. :)
